Sophie's First JavaScript Project - May 2021

Single Page Application (SPA)
Front End
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
JavaScript (JS)
Public Application Programming Interface (API)

Requirements:
1. Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) as the communication format.

2. Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

3. Some interactivity is required. This interactivity needs to incorporate at least 3 separate event listeners. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.

Project Pitch
1. The basic story of your application.
2. The core features of your Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
3. The API data
